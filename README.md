# CS-360

The goal was to plan and develop an application in android that would allow a user to track their weight, this could be for fitness, doctors recommendation, or just daily monitoring. The app needed to be able to store data related to both their account and weight records, display that data back to them in a clean organized way, and allow the user to update said information.

A home screen for a user to view and edit their data related to weight tracking and view progess and goal. A log in screen for auser to log in. A profile screen so a user can view and update recoreds such as username email address, name, age etc. A screen to congratulate the user when they reach their goal, allowing them to share the achievement with friends or family. Finally, a setting page, where a user can log out of their account and edit their goals.

I was able to to test my code through an emulater, as well as logging information throught to see when, where and why if something is not working correctly. The biggest challenge for me was  the bottom navigation bar. Getting it to function correctly as well as styling it. It was much more difficult than I had originally expected. I feel my databases and the recycleview to display weights was particulary successful, working as intentended and updating immediatly by utilizing event listeners.
